### 2 . [Construction Progress Dashboard]
This dashboard was developed to monitor the progress of construction projects. It came handy for submitting to client. If same client is having multiple projects then by giving simply one slicer to toggle between the projects.

Here is the Project Progress Dashboard:

### 3 . [Concrete Mastersheet]
This dashboard was as savior for our project. Power BI was not popular in construction industry back in 2019 but since i have already worked upon a few dashboard for my project i have realized that Power BI has made it very simple.
The purpose of this dashboard was to track the concrete production on daily basis that too we could filter itemwise/componentwise.
Here is the Concrete Mastersheet:
