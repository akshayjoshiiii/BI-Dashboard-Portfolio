### 3 . [Concrete Mastersheet] [Own Project]
This dashboard was as savior for our project. Power BI was not popular in construction industry back in 2019 but since i have already worked upon a few dashboard for my project i have realized that Power BI has made it very simple.
The purpose of this dashboard was to track the concrete production on daily basis that too we could filter itemwise/componentwise.
Here is the Concrete Mastersheet:
